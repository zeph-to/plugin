# UserPromptSubmit hook — remote-origin detection (ADR-0002) and the sticky
# REMOTE reminder that follows it.
#
# Two jobs, in this order:
#
#   1. Entry. The zeph listener records every phone→pane text injection as a
#      one-shot marker file (`remote-<hash>` under the zeph state dir) holding
#      the epoch second and sha256 of the injected text. When the submitted
#      prompt matches that record, the user is driving this session from their
#      phone, and the hook says so — which enters sticky REMOTE mode
#      (CORE_RULES Rule 9) so every response ends in an answerable zeph_ask.
#      Entry detection is exact: same project (cksum of the dir), fresh
#      (≤15 min), and byte-identical trimmed text. A terminal keystroke racing
#      a phone message can never false-match.
#
#   2. Leaving. The marker is one-shot, but REMOTE is not — it is recorded in
#      `remote-active-<hash>` (see gate.sh) so it outlives the entry turn and
#      survives context compaction, which is what Rule 13 promises. A prompt
#      that reaches this hook without a marker was typed at the terminal —
#      unless Claude Code wrote it itself (see system_turn below: a phone
#      answer to a zeph_ask can arrive that way). The user is back, so the
#      mode ends here — clear the state and say so once. Re-entry costs one
#      more phone message. The exceptions leave the mode exactly as it was: a
#      fresh marker left unmatched (a phone message is in flight — see
#      remote_origin_match's three-way verdict) and a system-written turn.
#
# No marker and no live state → silent no-op. This hook only ever adds context
# and must never block a prompt (always exit 0).

# Three-way verdict, because "not a phone message" and "typed at the terminal"
# are not the same claim and the exit branch may only act on the second:
#
#   0 PHONE      verified injection; marker consumed
#   1 KEYBOARD   no marker this prompt could ever have matched — the user typed
#   2 UNCLEAR    a fresh marker is sitting here unmatched, so a phone message is
#                in flight (queued behind a long turn, or a digest the two sides
#                compute differently). Ambiguous evidence must not be read as
#                "the user is back": that would drop them out of REMOTE while
#                they are still holding the phone, with no answerable push left.
#                Also an unreadable prompt while such a marker is pending. With
#                no marker in play an empty prompt still reads as KEYBOARD: the
#                listener never injects empty text, so there is nothing in
#                flight to be ambiguous about — and testing emptiness before
#                the marker would put a jq spawn on every prompt in every
