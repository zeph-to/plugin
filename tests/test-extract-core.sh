# Tests for scripts/extract-core.js (the CLI-bound core extractor).
#
# Guards these regressions:
#   - the extracted core must not steer by a mechanism the CLI harnesses never
#     receive. The manifest drops rules 1-2 (Push Signal) and rule 12 (the
#     /zeph-* dial), so surviving prose that says "your Push Signal" or "the
#     user's dial" is an unfollowable instruction on all eight of them
#     (PI-RULES-AUDIT F1, measured against a live pi install).
#   - the numbering the CLI harnesses see must read as a whole list. The manifest
#     drops rules 1-2 and 12, so the raw slice opens at 3 and jumps 11 -> 13,
#     which reads as truncated context (PI-RULES-AUDIT F4). The extractor
#     renumbers at render time; cross-references have to move with it or the
#     core points at rules that no longer carry those numbers.
#   - the disambiguation those sentences carried must survive the rewrite:
#     `<!-- zeph: exit -->` is a marker the CLI core DOES tell agents to emit,
#     and Rule 9 has to keep saying it is not a mode signal.
