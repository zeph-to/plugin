# Not a cross-repo contract (no TS twin); the approval gate lives only in the
# Claude Code plugin. Keep it out of cli/scripts/sync-from-plugin.mjs.

# The false-negative rows matter as much as the positives: a list that fires on
# `grep -rn deploy src/` teaches people to approve without reading, which is
# worse than having no gate.
